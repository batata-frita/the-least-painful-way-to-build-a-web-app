# The talk

## Title ideas

- Side-effects of a function of state
- A tale of fire?
- State as the single source of truth?
- Drumming?
- Turning heat into useful work
- React, redux and side-effects
- Async operations in modern web applications
- Fatigue-less side-effects
- How to make stuff happen in your web application?

## Points for the Abstract

- interact with the real world (backend systems, user interaction...)
- logic is easy, but interaction is hard
- application can be drawn in a white board (flow-charts are easy to work with) ??? (it is imperative and maybe doesn't make sense)
